# Handibot-Monochrome-Carving
App for carving grayscale image. The darker, the more profound it is carved.

##Versions:
* Pixellized  (maybe works, it has to be tested)
* Smoother (will be subdivised in other section) (nothing for the moment)

##TODO:
Those steps are not exhaustive, they are just guidelines. Maybe it will never be
done.
* Find simple paths (regardless to the anti-aliasing)
* Write the GCode according to the paths
* Check the anti-aliasing
* Maybe make a function to convert colorful image to grayscale
* Possibility to do right angle
