# Handibot-Monochrome-Carving
App for carving grayscale image. The darker, the more profound it is carved.

##TODO:
Those steps are not exhaustive, they are just guidelines.
1. Find simple paths (regardless to the anti-aliasing)
2. Write the GCode according to the paths
3. Check the anti-aliasing
4. Maybe make a function to convert colorful image to grayscale
5. Possibility to do right angle
